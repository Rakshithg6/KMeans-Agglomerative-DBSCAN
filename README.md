# KMeans-Agglomerative-DBSCAN

This repository contains implementations of three popular clustering algorithms: KMeans, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN. Clustering is a technique used in unsupervised machine learning to group similar data points together. Each algorithm has its own characteristics and is suitable for different types of data and use cases.

## KMeans

KMeans is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest centroid and updating the centroids based on the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster. It is simple, efficient, and easy to implement.


## Agglomerative

Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that starts with each data point as a single cluster and iteratively merges the closest clusters until the desired number of clusters is reached. It produces a tree-like hierarchy of clusters known as a dendrogram.


## DBSCAN

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together closely packed points based on a density threshold. It is capable of discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes and is robust to noise.
